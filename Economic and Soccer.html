November 7th, 2017 marks the 100 year anniversary of the October Revolution. Ever since the advent of Das Kapital, Communism has liberated SO MANY COUNTRIES!

<p>

The major revolutions Communism induced all over the world include:

<table>
  <tr><th>Leader and Location</th>        <th>Ruling Power Obtained?</th></tr>
  <tr><td>The Paris Commune</td>       <td class=trcell>No.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Lenin and October Revolution</td>     <td class=trcell>YES!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mao and the Chinese Revolution</td>  <td class=trcell>Most Definitely!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Kim and the Korean War</td>      <td class=trcell>Most Unfortunately!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Civil Protests since 1968 in the U.S.</td> <td class=uicell>Undergoing...</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

Even though communist and socialist regime are widely controversial in terms of its means and ends, Das Kapital is still by far the most insightful analysis on the capitalist mode of production, in which Marx breaks down the concept of exploitation and labor power.

<h1> Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!</h1>

Mao Zedong, one of the founders of People's Republic of China, a national idol for generations of people both domestically and internationally, died in 1976.
Mao is not only a revolutionist, but also a poet. During his life, he wrote thousands of poetry in classical Chinese form. He is also a public intellectual, whose polemic against orthodox Lenism originated his own "Maoism".

<p>
On the other hand, Mao is also blamed for initiating the "Cultural Revolution" and "A Great Leap Forward", where communist bureaucrats were incentivized to report fake production figures, in order to compete with the West. As a result, millions of Chinese died of fame in these political movements, aside from those died for political struggle. Nevertheless, Mao's influence still reached other countries such as Japan, France and the U.S..

  Young we were, schoolmates,<p>
  At life's full flowering;<p>
  Filled with student enthusiasm<p>
  Boldly we cast all restraints aside.<p>
  Pointing to our mountains and rivers,<p>
  Setting people afire with our words,<p>
  We counted the mighty no more than muck.<p>
  Remember still<p>
  How, venturing midstream, we struck the waters<p>
  And the waves stayed the speeding boats?<p>
                                -- an exerpt from Mao's "Changsha", 1925

  <h1>Kim Il-sung</h1>

The Great Leader, The Illustrious General of All Illustrious Generals, The Saint of All Saints, The Lodestar of the 21st Century, Sun of the Communist Future, Shining Star of Paektu Mountain, Guiding Sun Ray, Guarantee of the Fatherland's Unification, Bright Sun of Juche, Highest Incarnation of the Revolutionary Comradeship, and The Rocket Man.

<p>

Most leaders of socialist countries proclaim themselves as the true heritage of Karl Marx and communism, just as what Stalin, Mao and the Kim family did. Nonetheless, their ruling pattern corresponds more suitably with Leninist dictatorship. It is very important to distinguish a true communist, from those who pursue personal vendetta or crave for power, under the diguise of communism.
